# HugoTheme
A Hugo theme I designed for my blog at https://apurvnakade.github.io/blog/


## TODO:
0. Put useful links and references in this README file.
1. Make disqus hidden by default until someone clicks on 'comments'
2. Add buttons for facebook, twitter etc.

## Useful links:
1. Crosslinks in Hugo: https://gohugo.io/content-management/cross-references/
2. Beautiful icons: https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/black-white-social-media
